# Technical Fixes for CannaFlow Advanced - Pilot Ready

## 1. Fix Gradle/Kotlin Error (expo-barcode-scanner)

The expo-barcode-scanner version 13.0.1 has compatibility issues with newer Expo versions. We need to upgrade or replace it.

## 2. Run expo prebuild --clean

This will generate the native Android/iOS files needed for building APKs.

## 3. Fix Navigation Stability Issues

Ensure all navigation is working correctly across both business modes.

## 4. Fix Chart Rendering Issues

Ensure charts display correctly on Android devices.

## 5. Implement Missing MVP Features

- POS flow (cart, checkout, mock payments)
- Inventory CRUD operations
- Barcode scanner integration
- Staff authentication system
- Compliance basics (age verification, purchase limits)

## 6. Polish UI/UX

- Branding consistency
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Responsive design

## 7. Backend Setup

- Firebase/Supabase integration
- Crash logging with Sentry
- Error monitoring

## 8. Final APK Build

Build and test the final APK for pilot deployment.
